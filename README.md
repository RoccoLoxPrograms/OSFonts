The OS large and small fonts that can be used in C programs for the CE.
Just transfer the two AppVars to your calculator and then use FontLibC to access them and display text from the font pack.
There is also a program that is included that will display the character map for each font. Use the provided character map 
images to know the value of each character (add the row and the column together to get the decimal value).
